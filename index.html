          Character Creation
        </b>
          <br>
            <i>
              The first topic we are going to be covering in this tutorial is Character Creation!
              During the entirety of this, I'll be referring to one of my Characters; Shota Uchiha,
              as an example. Now, when creating a character you have two core subjects to think about.
              Personality and Background!
                <br>
                <br>
              Let's start with personality first, everyone has one.
              It makes us who we are, sometimes people can be quirky, sometimes they can be annoying! And sometimes,
              they can be both! Just like people, your Character has their own expansive personality. Now, when deciding
              how you want your Character to play, it's important to consider other things as well. Like alignment.
              Usually, if your Character is evil- they'll have a more sinister personality. But, that's where
              this tutorial comes in. When your making a character, you never want to be average. You want to experiment.
              So instead, try making a merciful Villain who is actually kind of nice- they are only portrayed as evil because
              of simple misunderstandings. In other words, try to be surprising! Think outside the box!
                <br>
                <br>
                Secondly, we're going to discuss Background! Now, similar to English Class- when writing the story behind your
                character- you typically want something interesting. Keep in mind that most characters involve harsh and rather
                repetitive backstories. This makes boring more regular and humane stories refreshing. I myself usually choose
                to exclusively do this. For example, Shota Uchiha comes from the Uchiha Family in the Naruto Universe. Usually,
                 Those within the Family have no parents. Mainly because they were killed off. Essentially, they're edgy. Shota
                 on the other hand has his entire family intact. He's very calm, and enjoys finger painting! Take note, little
                 hobbies with likes and dislikes can help you immensely when creating your Character!

              <b>Dialogue</b>
              <br>
              Dialogue is something very important when Roleplaying! It can be used dramatically, casually or competetively!
              It's like the life blood of your response! Usually, it is used to summarize what your actions are. Sometimes,
              it could be as simple as a yes or no! Now, Dialogue in Text Based Roleplay's take the form of many different
              formats, or rather symbols that indicate the start and finish of said dialogue! I'll be showing the three most common right now!
              <br>
              <ul{
    list-style-position: inside;
}>
                <li>"Example One!"</li>
                <li>[Example Two!]</li>
                <li>'Example Three!'</li>
              </ul>
              <br>
                Like Dialogue, Actions are a way to express your Character. And can be used for a variety of things. Ranging from combat to cleaning.
                It's the structural hold of your response. Without actions, your nothing but some one liner. Usually, they are much more complicated than
                dialogue because it holds personality. It's much more show than tell, though occasionally actions can take the form of thoughts.
                Universally, we have three different ways to show that we are doing an action. I'll be showing the three most common below!
                <br>
                <ul{
      list-style-position: inside;
  }>
                  <li><i>Example One!</i></li>
                  <li><b>Example Two!</b></li>
                  <li><i><b>Example Three!</b></i></li>
                </ul>
